<p> When you open any webpage in a browser, the HTML of the page is loaded and rendered visually on the screen.
To accomplish that, the browser builds the Document Object Model of that page, which is an object oriented model of its logical structure.</p>

<p><h1>JavaScript can be used to manipulate the DOM of a page dynamically to add, delete and modify elements.</h1></p>
<p>
There is a predefined document object in JavaScript, which can be used to access all elements on the DOM.
In other words, the document object is the owner (or root) of all objects in your webpage.
So, if you want to access objects in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object.

document.body.innerHTML = "Some";

<script> 
var para=document.getElementById("demo");
//document.write(para.length);
var child=para.childNodes;
document.write(child.length);
